Asymptotic Efficiency When we look at input size $n$ large enough that only the order of growth matters. We are concerned with the running time in the limit as input increases without bound.
Asymptotic Notation Notation is defined as a function on domain $\mathbb{N} = { 0,1,2,\dots }$, the set of natural numbers.</description></item><item><title>CLRS - Getting Started</title><link>https://andrelimzs.github.io/posts/getting-started/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 17:43:50 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://andrelimzs.github.io/posts/getting-started/</guid><description>Objective The main objective of CLRS is to introduce frameworks to design and analyze algorithms.
Terminology Loop Invariant Something used to prove the correctness of an algorithm, with three properties:
Initialization It is true prior to the first iteration of the loop Maintenance If it is true before an iteration, it remains true after that iteration Termination It helps show that the algorithm is correct after the loop terminates Commonly used in combination with the termination condition Input Size, $n$ Depends on the problem, but commonly:</description></item></channel></rss>
