Significant chatter
2) 1F, 2mm DOC, 0.6mm WOC, 0.08 FPT, 150m/min, 45N Dropping DOC &amp;amp; WOC and increasing FPT seems to reduce chatter
3) 1F, 1.2mm DOC, 0.4mm WOC, 0.16 FPT, 75m/min, 54N Even less chatter

I added the linear modules and custom plates, spindle and fixture plate Finally the enclosure, motors and limit switches Electronics I can&amp;rsquo;t be sure of the quality of these power supplies, so I&amp;rsquo;m using one for the steppers and another for the spindle. I hope this prevents noise from the spindle affecting the steppers.</description></item><item><title>G2Core Motion Controller</title><link>https://andrelimzs.github.io/posts/cnc-mill/2020-06-19-g2core-motion-controller/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 16:21:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrelimzs.github.io/posts/cnc-mill/2020-06-19-g2core-motion-controller/</guid><description>G2Core is a motion control system, similar to grbl, mach3/4, linuxCNC, etc. It runs on a 32-bit ARM Cortex M3 Arduino Due, which means plenty of power for additional features.

(2000). Principles of rapid machine design. It covers design and manufacturing principles, calculations and simulations, and experimental data.
Design Principles Stiffness Budget &amp;ldquo;One of the most important criteria is the effective stiffness of the tool/work piece interface, measured in force per unit deflection $N/\mu m$.&amp;rdquo; Bamberg states that values of 10 to 25 are desirable for machining.</description></item><item><title>CNC Mill V3</title><link>https://andrelimzs.github.io/posts/cnc-mill/2020-06-15-cnc-mill-v3/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2020 07:05:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrelimzs.github.io/posts/cnc-mill/2020-06-15-cnc-mill-v3/</guid><description>The parts are going to take a while to arrive, so in the meantime I&amp;rsquo;m refining my design again. I went from a XY-Z configuration to Y-XZ. This frees up space in both the x and z axes and should make it easier to put additional reinforcement as well as a future 4th axis.
The y-axis table also extends out of the frame, which will make it easier to load/unload the machine.</description></item><item><title>Improving Rigidity</title><link>https://andrelimzs.github.io/posts/cnc-mill/2020-06-10-improving-rigidity/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2020 07:21:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrelimzs.github.io/posts/cnc-mill/2020-06-10-improving-rigidity/</guid><description>When we last left off we managed to get 20 μm, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to improve on it.
Spindle Brace Adding
Stainless steel sheet metal (5 mm) brace between the spindle and rear column Aluminum sheet (4 mm) at the bottom reduces deflection (at 110 N) from 20 μm to 16 μm.
Column Brace Adding a 60 x 200 x 5 mm stainless steel plate reduces deflection from 16 μm to 14.</description></item><item><title>CNC Mill V2</title><link>https://andrelimzs.github.io/posts/cnc-mill/2020-06-09-cnc-mill-v2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2020 04:25:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrelimzs.github.io/posts/cnc-mill/2020-06-09-cnc-mill-v2/</guid><description>Design Goal (Quantified) After a few more weeks of research and reading up I have decided to use deflection at the spindle as my primary design goal. I plan to use depth of cut (DOC) + width of cut (WOC) to estimate the acceptable deflection.
Depth of Cut DOC in aluminum ranges from 0.254mm/0.76mm/1.6mm (Shapeoko Wiki) to 2.54mm (Vince Fab) and 6.35mm (Shapeoko Forum).
Recommendations for the Tormach PCNC1100 is also 6.</description></item><item><title>Back to Serial</title><link>https://andrelimzs.github.io/posts/cnc-mill/2020-06-08-back-to-serial/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 17:24:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrelimzs.github.io/posts/cnc-mill/2020-06-08-back-to-serial/</guid><description>Tripteron The Tripteron is a 3 DoF parallel cartesian robot. It is decoupled, which means each axis can be controlled independently and isotropic, which means it&amp;rsquo;s dexterity is unchanged throughout the workspace.
Practical Limitations But there are some serious obstacles to building a parallel CNC as a first machine. It needs many precise, high strength joints. Precise because any backlash gets magnified by the length of the chain. Strong because the length also results in a large moment.</description></item><item><title>Inverse Kinematics, Velocity &amp; Acceleration Analysis</title><link>https://andrelimzs.github.io/posts/cnc-mill/2020-05-24-inverse-kinematics-velocity-acceleration-analysis/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2020 16:27:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrelimzs.github.io/posts/cnc-mill/2020-05-24-inverse-kinematics-velocity-acceleration-analysis/</guid><description>Overview Notation $$ \begin{aligned} &amp;amp;\Theta &amp;amp;&amp;amp;: \text{Joint velocities} \cr &amp;amp;\Theta_{a/p} &amp;amp;&amp;amp;: \text{Active/Passive} \cr &amp;amp;W &amp;amp;&amp;amp;: \text{Twist} \cr &amp;amp;V &amp;amp;&amp;amp;: \text{Velocity of end-effector} \cr &amp;amp; \Omega &amp;amp;&amp;amp;: \text{Angular Velocity} \cr &amp;amp; X &amp;amp;&amp;amp;: \text{Generalized coordinates} \end{aligned} $$

P. 2006). They have several advantages over serial manipulators such as accuracy and stiffness.
Because the chains are independent, each link does not have to support all subsequent links and can be lighter and smaller. The lower load and shorter link length reduce the (unmeasured) deformation in the system. The shorter kinematic chains also reduce the effect of deformation, actuator error and measurement error on the final end-effector position.</description></item><item><title>Designing a CNC Mill</title><link>https://andrelimzs.github.io/posts/cnc-mill/2020-05-23-designing-a-cnc-mill/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 May 2020 13:03:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andrelimzs.github.io/posts/cnc-mill/2020-05-23-designing-a-cnc-mill/</guid><description>Overview I’ve been looking at getting a CNC mill to machine small, strong, metal parts. Initially I looked at the chinese mills such as the 3018 ($400). But they have a reputation of not lasting very long. Then I moved on to the Shapeoko 3 ($1550) and OpenBuilds C-Beam ($1200), but they’re too big to fit comfortably in an apartment. The Carbide3D Nomad ($2750) would be perfect. It is rigid, compact and easily enclosed.</description></item></channel></rss>
