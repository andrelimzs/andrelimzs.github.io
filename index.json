The optimal tradeoff requires computing the correct model complexity.\nModel Complexity : Can be a function of the parameters ($l_2$ norm) and not just the number of parameters\nRegularization : Allows us to:\nControl model complexity Prevent overfitting Regularizer Function A regularizer $R(\\theta)$, is a function which measures model complexity. It is usually nonnegative.\nIn classical methods : $R(\\theta)$ depends only on parameters $\\theta$\nIn modern methods : $R(\\theta,x,y)$ can depend on the data\n$R(\\theta)$ is added to the training loss/cost to get the regularized loss $J_\\lambda$ $$ J_\\lambda(\\theta) = \\underbrace{J(\\theta)}_\\text{training loss} + \\lambda \\underbrace{R(\\theta)}_\\text{regularizer} $$ Parameter $\\lambda$ : Determines the balance between training loss and regularization. A small $\\lambda$ serves as a \u0026ldquo;tiebreaker\u0026rdquo; for equally effective models.\nWeight Decay One of the most commonly used is $l_2$ regularization. In deep learning it is also known as weight decay, where parameter weights gradually grow smaller over time.\nThe update rule for weight decay is $$ \\theta \\quad \\leftarrow \\underbrace{(1 - \\lambda \\eta)\\ \\cdot }_\\text{decaying weights} \\theta - \\eta \\nabla J(\\theta) $$ Is equivalent to $l_2$ regularization $$ \\theta \\leftarrow \\theta - \\eta( \\underbrace{\\nabla J(\\theta)}_\\text{loss} \\quad + \\underbrace{\\lambda \\theta}_\\text{regularizer} ) $$\nImposing Inductive Bias / Structure Regularization can also impose inductive bias or structure.\nIt imposes structure that narrows the search space. This reduces the complexity of the model family and improves generalization\nBUT, if the structure is wrong it will increase bias / underfitting.\nImplicit Regularization Effect Implicit regularization of optimizers / implicit bias / algorithmic regularization is the concept that \u0026ldquo;optimizers can implicitly impose structure\u0026rdquo; on models.\nIt is a new phenomenon observed in deep learning which might be responsible for performance in the overparameterized regime.\nBackground In classical machine learning, loss functions have a unique global minima that all optimizers converge to. However in deep learning, the loss often has multiple approximate global minima.\nDifferent optimizers tend to converge to different types of global minima. The different minima have different properties that make some generalize better than others.\nExample CS229 https://cs229.stanford.edu/\nIllustration of how certain minimas generalize better\nComponents which provide Regularization Open research question, but empirically:\nLarger initial learning rates Smaller initialization Smaller batch size Momentum Types of Global Minima which Generalize well A conjecture is that stochasticity in the optimizer helps to find flatter minima, which generalize better\nCross Validation Cross validation is a method of training and testing models on different portions of data to access the performance (true generalization) of the model.\nSimple (Hold-Out) Cross Validation Split dataset $S$ into $S_\\text{train}$ (approx. 70%) and $S_\\text{test}$(approx. 30%) Train various models on $S_\\text{train}$ and test on $S_\\text{test}$ Pick model with the smallest error This methods generates better estimates of a model\u0026rsquo;s generalization / test error, because it is tested on unseen data.\nDisadvantages It \u0026ldquo;wastes\u0026rdquo; around 30% of the dataset, even if the model is subsequently retrained on the entire dataset.\nK-Fold Cross Validation Split the data into $k$ disjoint subsets Test each model on all but one of the subsets Select model with the smallest error Retrain model on entire dataset Is a method to reduce the amount of data wasted. It only holds out $\\frac{1}{k}$ of the data.\nAdvantages : More efficient at using data, it uses $\\frac{k-1}{k}$ of the data\nDisadvantage : Computationally expensive, each model is trained $k$ times\n$k=10$ is a common choice\nLeave-one-out Cross Validation Is a more extreme variant where $k = m$, the number of training examples. At every iteration, only one training example is left out.\nBayesian Regularization Frequentist Bayesian $\\theta$ unknown constant-valued $\\theta$ is a random variable Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) Maximum a posterior (MAP) $\\arg \\max_\\theta \\prod p(y | x;\\theta)$ $\\arg \\max_\\theta \\prod p(y | x;\\theta) \\ p(\\theta)$ Previous sections treated the parameter fitting as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem. The parameters $\\theta$ are treated as an unknown constant-value. $$ \\theta_\\text{MLE} = \\arg \\max_\\theta \\prod^n_{i=1} {p(y^{(i)}\\ | x^{(i)} ;\\ \\theta)} $$ An alternative interpretation is the Bayesian view, where $\\theta$ is a random variable (RV).\nBayesian Prediction In \u0026ldquo;fully Bayesian\u0026rdquo; prediction, the prediction is the average w.r.t. the posterior $p(\\theta | S)$ over $\\theta$ $$ \\mathbb E [y | x, S] = \\int_y y\\ p(y|x,S)\\ dy $$ Where the posterior distribution on the class label is $$ p(y|x,S) = \\int_\\theta p(y|x,\\theta) \\ p(\\theta|S) \\ d\\theta $$ And the posterior distribution on the class labels is computed from Bayes rule $$ p(\\theta | S) = \\frac {\\left( \\prod p(y|x,\\theta) \\right) p(\\theta)} {\\int_\\theta \\left( \\prod p(y|x,\\theta) \\right) p(\\theta) \\ d\\theta} $$\nMaximum A Posteriori Approximation In general it is very difficult / expensive to compute the posterior distribution. There is no closed-form solution, and the high-dimension $\\theta$ makes it intractable.\nA common approximation is to use a single point estimate, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate $$ \\theta_\\text{MAP} = \\arg \\max_\\theta \\prod^n_{i=1} {p(y^{(i)}\\ | x^{(i)} ;\\ \\theta)} \\ p(\\theta) $$\nChoice of Prior $p(\\theta)$ A common choice is $$ \\theta \\sim \\mathcal{N} (0, \\tau^2 I) $$ Which has a smaller norm than MLE.

P. 2006). They have several advantages over serial manipulators such as accuracy and stiffness.\nBecause the chains are independent, each link does not have to support all subsequent links and can be lighter and smaller. The lower load and shorter link length reduce the (unmeasured) deformation in the system. The shorter kinematic chains also reduce the effect of deformation, actuator error and measurement error on the final end-effector position.\nIn a CNC machine In the case of a 3-axis CNC machine, at least 2 axes will be in series. In the previous post it is the y and z-axis. Any deformation in the y-axis is magnified by the length of the z-axis. Any forces on the spindle are also multiplied by the z-axis.\nStrength of Aluminum Extrusion Before delving into parallel mechanisms, I need to determine if rigidity and accuracy are a problem in the current design. I will start with the frame.\nA design based on aluminum extrusions will depend largely on the strength of the fasteners. The standard 2020 extrusion has a wall thickness of 2 mm, and a overhang of 3 mm. T-nuts have widths from 6 – 15 mm. This imposes a limit on the bolt tension before it starts to shear off the extrusion wall. The bolt tension and coefficient of friction (between aluminum and steel, not high) further limits the ability of joints to resist sliding.\nThe layout of each joint also affects it\u0026rsquo;s strength. An extrusion that lays on top of another extrusion is much stronger than a joint that depends only on friction. The final option is to drill a hole, and bolt straight through the extrusion.\nDeformation and Accuracy Based on the FEA simulation, we saw a deflection of 0.8 – 1.6 mm with 10 N of force. A 500 W spindle cutting aluminum is capable of generating around 30 – 60 N of force on the frame (at higher depth of cut). The simulation also overestimated the fastener joints.\nThis means that in the current design, frame rigidity is a major bottleneck in cutting metal. One obvious solution is to change the material and/or method of construction. This would definitely increase the cost and amount of fabrication required.\nI think that I will stick to aluminum extrusions because of its low cost, availability and the sheer convenience of being able to bolt a frame together. My hope is that a parallel mechanism design will overcome the material limitations.\nPlanar Parallel Mechanism I think the most obvious starting point is to have a spindle mounted on a moving z-axis, and a planar parallel mechanism to replace an x-y table. One of the most common, and well-studied mechanisms is the 3-RPR robot.\nThe notation reads as: 3 independent legs with revolute – prismatic – revolute joints per leg. Each leg will have one active (driven) joint and two passive joints, most commonly the prismatic joint.\nMATLAB Simulation (and visualization) I started by writing a quick kinematic simulation in MATLAB. The base are denoted by blue circles, platform by red circles and legs by black lines. The grey circles show the maximum extension of each prismatic joint. There is no limit on the range for the revolute joints.\nIn subsequent posts I will explore\nThe workspace Which are the locations that can be reached Singularities Which are poses where the mechanism loses controllability and/or rigidity Velocity, acceleration and static analysis Used to determine the relation between joint velocities/force and end-effector velocity/force ","permalink":"https://andrelimzs.github.io/posts/cnc-mill/2020-05-23-parallel-manipulators/","summary":"Background Parallel manipulators are closed-loop kinematic chain mechanisms linked by several independent chains (Merlet, J.
