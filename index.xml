      <description>Reinforcement Learning Many sequential decision making and control problems are hard to provide explicit supervision for.
Instead provide a reward function and let the learning algorithm figure out how to choose actions over time.
Successful in applications such as helicopter flight, legged locomotion, network routing, marketing strategy selection, etc
Markov Decision Processes (MDP) Provide formalism for many RL problems
Terminology States : $s$ Actions : $a$ State Transition Probabilities : $P_{sa}$ Discount Factor : $\gamma \in [0,1)$ Reward Function : $R : S \times A \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ Dynamics of MDPs Start in some state $s_0$ Choose some action $a_0 \in A$ MDP randomly transitions to successor state $s_1 \sim P_{s_0a_0}$ Pick another action Repeat Represent as $$ s_0 \overset{a_0}{\rightarrow} s_1 \overset{a_1}{\rightarrow} s_2 \overset{a_2}{\rightarrow} s_3 \overset{a_3}{\rightarrow} \dots $$ Total Payoff $$ R(s_0, a_0) + \gamma R(s_1, a_1) + \gamma^2 R(s_2, a_2) + \dots $$ Goal : Maximise expected value of total payoff $$ E \left[ R(s_0) + \gamma R(s_1) + \gamma^2 R(s_2) + \dots \right] $$</description>

      <description>Deep Learning Supervised with Nonlinear Models Supervised learning is
Predict $y$ from input $x$ Suppose model/hypothesis is $h_\theta(x)$ Previous methods have considered
Linear regression : $h_\theta(x) = \theta^Tx$ Kernel method : $h_\theta(x) = \theta^T \phi(x)$ Both are linear in $\theta$
Now consider models that are nonlinear in both
Parameters : $\theta$ Inputs : $x$ The most common of which is the neural network
Cost/Loss Function Define least-squares cost for one sample $$ J^{(i)}(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} ( h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 $$ and mean-square cost for the dataset $$ J(\theta) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} J^{(i)}(\theta) $$</description>

      <description>Generative Learning Different approach to learning
Try to model $p(x|y)$ and $p(y)$ instead of learning $p(y|x)$ directly
$p(x|y)$ : Distribution of the target&amp;rsquo;s features $p(y)$ : Class priors Use Bayes rule to calculate posterior distribution $p(y|x)$ $$ p(y|x) = \frac{p(x|y) p(y)}{p(x)} $$ Can be simplified when using for prediction because denominator doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter $$ \arg \max_y P(y|x) = \arg \max_y p(x|y) p(y) $$

      <description>Review of Probability Theory Overview Probability is an important aspect of machine learning, and forms a useful basis for concepts. It is the study of uncertainty
Elements of Probability Defining probability on a set requires the following:
Sample Space : $\Omega$
The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment Each outcome $\omega \in \Omega$ is the complete description of the state at the end of the experiment Event Space (Set of events) : $\mathcal{F}$</description>

      <description>1) 2F, 4mm DOC, 1.6mm WOC, 0.02 FPT, 150 m/min, 90N Too much DOC/WOC and not enough feed-per-tooth? Significant chatter
2) 1F, 2mm DOC, 0.6mm WOC, 0.08 FPT, 150m/min, 45N Dropping DOC &amp;amp; WOC and increasing FPT seems to reduce chatter
3) 1F, 1.2mm DOC, 0.4mm WOC, 0.16 FPT, 75m/min, 54N Even less chatter
4) Non-adaptive climb milling 1F, 0.8mm DOC, 0.4mm WOC, 0.16 FPT, 150m/min, 72N Looks good</description>

      <description>Frame This was the basic frame, made up of only extrusions and joints. I added the linear modules and custom plates, spindle and fixture plate Finally the enclosure, motors and limit switches Electronics I can&amp;rsquo;t be sure of the quality of these power supplies, so I&amp;rsquo;m using one for the steppers and another for the spindle. I hope this prevents noise from the spindle affecting the steppers.</description>

      <description>I stumbled on an excellent resource, Principles of Rapid Machine Design Bamberg, E. (2000). Principles of rapid machine design. It covers design and manufacturing principles, calculations and simulations, and experimental data.
Design Principles Stiffness Budget &amp;ldquo;One of the most important criteria is the effective stiffness of the tool/work piece interface, measured in force per unit deflection $N/\mu m$.&amp;rdquo; Bamberg states that values of 10 to 25 are desirable for machining.</description>

      <description>The parts are going to take a while to arrive, so in the meantime I&amp;rsquo;m refining my design again. I went from a XY-Z configuration to Y-XZ. This frees up space in both the x and z axes and should make it easier to put additional reinforcement as well as a future 4th axis.
The y-axis table also extends out of the frame, which will make it easier to load/unload the machine.</description>

      <description>When we last left off we managed to get 20 Î¼m, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to improve on it.
Spindle Brace Adding
Stainless steel sheet metal (5 mm) brace between the spindle and rear column Aluminum sheet (4 mm) at the bottom reduces deflection (at 110 N) from 20 Î¼m to 16 Î¼m.
Column Brace Adding a 60 x 200 x 5 mm stainless steel plate reduces deflection from 16 Î¼m to 14.</description>

      <description>Design Goal (Quantified) After a few more weeks of research and reading up I have decided to use deflection at the spindle as my primary design goal. I plan to use depth of cut (DOC) + width of cut (WOC) to estimate the acceptable deflection.
Depth of Cut DOC in aluminum ranges from 0.254mm/0.76mm/1.6mm (Shapeoko Wiki) to 2.54mm (Vince Fab) and 6.35mm (Shapeoko Forum).
Recommendations for the Tormach PCNC1100 is also 6.</description>

      <description>Tripteron The Tripteron is a 3 DoF parallel cartesian robot. It is decoupled, which means each axis can be controlled independently and isotropic, which means it&amp;rsquo;s dexterity is unchanged throughout the workspace.
Practical Limitations But there are some serious obstacles to building a parallel CNC as a first machine. It needs many precise, high strength joints. Precise because any backlash gets magnified by the length of the chain. Strong because the length also results in a large moment.</description>

      <title>Parallel Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://andrelimzs.github.io/posts/cnc-mill/2020-05-23-parallel-manipulators/</link>

      <guid>https://andrelimzs.github.io/posts/cnc-mill/2020-05-23-parallel-manipulators/</guid>
      <description>Background Parallel manipulators are closed-loop kinematic chain mechanisms linked by several independent chains (Merlet, J. P. 2006). They have several advantages over serial manipulators such as accuracy and stiffness.
Because the chains are independent, each link does not have to support all subsequent links and can be lighter and smaller. The lower load and shorter link length reduce the (unmeasured) deformation in the system. The shorter kinematic chains also reduce the effect of deformation, actuator error and measurement error on the final end-effector position.</description>

      <description>Overview Iâ€™ve been looking at getting a CNC mill to machine small, strong, metal parts. Initially I looked at the chinese mills such as the 3018 ($400). But they have a reputation of not lasting very long. Then I moved on to the Shapeoko 3 ($1550) and OpenBuilds C-Beam ($1200), but theyâ€™re too big to fit comfortably in an apartment. The Carbide3D Nomad ($2750) would be perfect. It is rigid, compact and easily enclosed.</description>
