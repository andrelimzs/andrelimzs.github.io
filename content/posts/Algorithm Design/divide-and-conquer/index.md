## Objective

Many algorithms are **recursive**, and many recursive algorithms use the **divide-and-conquer** approach.

> Break the problem into smaller, but similar subproblems, solve them recursively, then combine the solutions

It involves three steps:

1. **Divide** \
   the problem into smaller instances of the same problem
2. **Conquer** \
   each subproblem recursively
3. **Combine** \
   the solutions
